linux kernel bug to study: nftables buffer overflow vulnerability CVE-2023-0179. Details:

https://groups.google.com/g/syzkaller/c/YRNDJBsJn_s?pli=1

 
If you're running linux, you can usually find the kernel in the /boot/ directory, called vmlinuz-[version]. You will need to uncompress it. The uncompressed form is vmlinux-[version].

Alternatively, you can download an old distro release, e.g. https://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/


The tasks are:

    Understand the vulnerability from the write-up. It's quite detailed. Take note of which versions are vulnerable.

    Find a kernel to study, uncompress it, load it in Binary Ninja

    Find the vulnerable function(s). I don't know if there are function names. If there are, great. If not, you can try https://github.com/marin-m/vmlinux-to-elf

    Verify whether the vulnerability is there or not

    Repeat to analyse one vulnerable and one not vulnerable version.
